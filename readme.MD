#HackCU

Oculus project for HackCU

Project Idea:

Targeted for pre-teen, autistic kids. 

We find that many kids entered middle school haven't mastered the skill of reading emotions on a face.
They don't understand when someone is upset or angry or happy, and don't know how to respond to these emotions.

The purpose of this virtual reality app is to create an avatar that will recreate emotions that many people show.
The challenge in this is that the user will have to identify the type of emotion the avatar is feeling, as well as
stating the correct response to that emotion. 

The motivation to continue playing this app will be when they choose the correct answer, they will get a credit.
With this credit that they build, they will eventually be able to play a short, reward game. 
The point of this game will be to make the user want to continue the app in order to gain more credit and play the reward game more.
